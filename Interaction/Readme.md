I wasn't able to load all my models from my blender projects.

The process for importing and running my models on OpenGL:

-Started off by running the dog template code provided on canvas.
-Replaced the dog with 1 of my models.
-Added multiple models into opengl but the image textures were breaking
-So I combined the textures of all objects into 1 texture map using a procedure called 'Baking'.
-Added texture map and models into OpenGL.
-Added camera movements using Keys Up, Down, Left, Right for moving around in the scene
-Added camera rotations using keys I, J, K and L for rotating around different angles.
-Added camera movements using keys W and S to zoom in and out of the scene.
