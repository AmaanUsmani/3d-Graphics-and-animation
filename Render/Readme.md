Inspiration for picking this topic : Came across a 3d dungeon diorama on google images and found the idea really interesting

Model choices : Searched youtube for low poly dungeon scenes and picked the most appropriate and interesting models

Scene Idea : No references , temporary scene layout sketched after making models -> keeping in mind the placement of all models in the scene -> Improvised scene later on to get a better rendered image

Lighting placements : Added a main area light to give light for the entire room dungeon -> added lights on tip of torches -> added lights in treasure chest to make coins glow -> added lights near acid sources to make it look radioactive and dangerous

HDRI - Added a night hdri image to make the dungeon room darker and give a spooky feel

Render - Rendered using Eevee render engine with ambient occlusion and bloom enabled to give the light sources brighter



How all objects were modelled 
-----------------------------

Model (Treasure Chest) : Followed the reference video from youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJf9G4NMdt4
--Modified the treasure chest by adding 2 black stripes across by bevelling loop cuts
--Modifying the treasure chest by adding the keyhole in the lock using knife tool and extruding inwards.
  
Model (Table and chair) : No references
--Made the basic shape of the table by adding a cube and scaling for table top -> adding a cube and scaling for table legs -> duplicating 3 times -> joining full mesh
--Made the basic shape of chair by adding a cube and scaling for chair seat -> adding loop cut and extruding for chair top -> adding a cube and scaling for chair legs -> duplicating 3 times -> joining full mesh
--Gave the table a spooky and old feel by making the shape unsymmetric i.e by adding more loop cuts -> selecting the loops moving them around -> bevelling edges -> deleting a few faces
--Added a few extra edges using knife tool

Model (Weapons) : Followed reference video from youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVQsiLYbsP4&t=429s
--Modified weapon shapes and changed colors to make it look more medieval

Model (Drain Leaking Acid) : Following steps from timelapse youtube video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPHoGpEL5CE&t=464s
--Modified drain shape -> simplified model by reducing poly count

Model (Shelf with Potion Bottles) : Idea from - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8mYkcimCjk
--Made shelf cracks using tools like bevelling edges -> deleting faces -> moving vertices around
--Made potion bottles using low poly spheres -> extruding the top faces -> scaling and extruding again for making top

Model (Torch) : Followed reference video from youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9ZNpSHx0H4&t=1s

Model (Purple Globe) : Idea from - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8mYkcimCjk
--Made bottom from a plane circle -> filling and extruding top -> inset tool -> extruding outwards to make the logo/label area
--Top part using low poly icosphere -> increasing metal material to make it shiny

Model (Walls and Pillars) : Followed reference video from youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9ZNpSHx0H4&t=1s
--Scaled pillars in z axis to fit scene height
--Duplicated walls -> placed on top of each other to fit scene height

Model (Bookshelf with books) : No reference for bookshelf , reference for basic book shape - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-u1EboGmyk
--Made basic bookshelf shape using scaling cubes -> rotated the bookshelf racks to add a spooky/old feel
--Modified book shapes by adding thickness to book -> duplicating them -> placing them on different places on the bookshelf

Model (Floor Tiles) : Followed reference video from youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBdNZIs1U8w
--Adding Subdivision Surface modifier and displacement modifier
--Changed displacement modifier to voronoi crackle and adjusting depth values to get an appropriate design for tiles

Model (Cooking Pot with Acid) : Followed reference video from youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8mYkcimCjk
--Modified Pot shape to make it look cracked for a spooky/old feel

Model (Barrel) : Followed reference video from youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9ZNpSHx0H4&t=1s
--Modified shape and and simplified shape making it lower poly

Model (Wooden Bridge) : Followed reference video from youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqxYEADY0KQ
--Modified and rearranged plank positions to give a spooky/broken feel
--Made a whole in 1 of the planks to fit axe model in it for the scene

Model (Bones) : Reference from multiple google images
--Made skull using a cube for the general shape -> adding multiple loopcuts/dividing the skull into multiple polygons -> individually moving vertices to give the skull shape
--Made skull eyes by selecting 2 faces -> extruding inwards 
--Made skull nose by using knife tool -> extruding inwards
--Made skull bottom by extruding 3 faces from bottom of the skull -> bevelling and adjusting it accoriding to shape.
--Made Ribcage by adding multiple loopcuts on a scaled cube -> extruding along normals -> and curving the ribs
--Made bones by adding loopcuts on a bones and extruding seperate faces from the ends of the cubes -> adding ico spheres -> joining them on end of bones

Model (Metal Chains Hanging) - No reference from wood planks , learnt curve modifier from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyA8gViQVn0&t=289s

Model (Door) - Idea from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIb1WPbey3c&t=2181s
